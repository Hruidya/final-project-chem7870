#The examples in this folder are Single-Molecule Tracking Data of proteins and they have been taken directly from literature.
#These data have the coordinate evolution of protein molecules in millisecond timescale, therefore, simulating underdamped Brownian motion
#is not possible in this timescale. In order to obtain underdamped Langevin dynamics, one must go for the femtoseconds or nanoseconds timescale.
